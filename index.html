    <h1>Christine's winter activity recommendations!</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Christine Suk, and as a person who loves being with friends but also loves solitude here are my 
        recent activities that made memories! 
    </p>
<!--Bowness ice skating-->
<h2 class="activities">Bowness River Ice Skating</h2>

    One of my favourite places in Calgary during winter is Bowness river to ice skate or like I did the last time (since the rentals were closed and sadly I do not currently own skates myself)
    is to walk around the river. The lights especially during the night is so pretty, perfect to take pictures, make memories with the people you love. 
    I love getting a hot drink to sip on as well like lattes or hot chocolate :) Try out the cafe on the deck as well! It is a cute little cafe perfect to warm up when you are too cold.

    One of the all-time winter classics is enjoying the beautiful lights at night. The Winter Zoo is a great experience with friends—especially if the weather isn’t too cold. 
    Even in winter, you can visit animals in both outdoor and indoor exhibits, like red pandas, Canadian wildlife, and monkeys.
     No matter what your favorite animal is, the Calgary Zoo is definitely worth a visit.
    If you’re not that into animals, the zoo's famous holiday lights display is still a must-see. You can stroll through the zoo as it’s beautifully lit up. And there’s more than just the lights—there are also fun activities like ice skating and axe throwing 
    (I tried it myself, but let’s just say... I wasn’t very good at it!).

<!--Oil painting class-->
<h2 class="activities">Oil Painting Class</h2>

<p>I have always been a lover of art. From sketching to painting, and crafting I love being creative which also a reason why I chose this IDD program. I recently have been 
    taking oil painting classes, which is a lot of fun, I get to sit and paint with occasional instructor's help with painting teqniques. These art classes are fun activities to do in winter. Although I haven't has a chance to 
    get to know the other classmates but I can tell they are all exicited to join the class each time. It is very sweet seeing people old and young shine with spark when they are in love what they are learning.
